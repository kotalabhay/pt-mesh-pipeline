It will also contribute to the existing evidence-base on refugee integration and help to guide the future New Scots approach in Scotland.A range of potential questions for the evaluation have been identified, both in relation to the evaluation of the New Scots strategy (Table 1) and the evaluation of the AMIF-funded projects (Table 2), which provide a starting point for types of questions the evaluation should seek to answer. The questions draw on the evaluation questions set out in the MEL framework and cover three key areas: process, outcomes, and learning.It should be noted that the questions identified do not need to be taken as a definitive list, but should instead act as a guide to the sort of questions we would anticipate the evaluation to address in order to meet the overarching aims outlined above.

Carbon capture is a fundamental element in the transition to low carbon economy. Molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) technology is highly appealing: it does not only capture CO2 but also produces electrical energy at the same time. Furthermore, the high operating temperature (~600 ºC) enables MCFC to internally process a wide spectrum of fuel and flue gases.
